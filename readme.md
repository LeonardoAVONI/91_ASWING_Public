## ASWING Official Documentation
### Quick Introduction
[ASWING](https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/aswing/) is a computational tool developed at MIT by **Mark Drela** for the **aerodynamic, structural, and control analysis of aircraft**.  
It is designed for **time-domain** or **frequency-domain** simulation of **flexible aircraft dynamics**; and it allows users to investigate both **steady and unsteady flight mechanics**.  

Comprehensive documentation and theoretical background (steady and unsteady formulations) are available on the [official ASWING page](https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/aswing/), along with sample input files and example calculations.

## Romain Jan Validation Work
ASWING has been extensively validated in the PhD work of **Romain Jan**,  
titled *"RÃ©cupÃ©ration d'Ã©nergie sur drone Ã  voilure souple"* (*Energy Recovery for Flexible Wing UAV*)  
([thesis link](https://theses.fr/2023ESAE0046), [PDF](https://depozit.isae.fr/theses/2023/2023_Jan_Romain.pdf)).

Throughout his thesis, Jan systematically compared **ASWING predictions** with **experimental measurements** and **high-order CFD simulations**, providing a detailed assessment of the softwareâ€™s reliability for aeroelastic and flight mechanics applications.  
The validation effort is documented both in his thesis and in a dedicated series of four reports:

- **Part I: Aerodynamics**  
  [Experimental validation of an aeroelasticity framework â€“ ASWING, Part I](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377724794_Experimental_validation_of_an_aeroelasticity_framework_ASWING_Part_I_Aerodynamics)

- **Part II: Propellers**  
  [Experimental validation of an aeroelasticity framework â€“ ASWING, Part II](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377725378_Experimental_validation_of_an_aeroelasticity_framework_ASWING_Part_II_Propellers)

- **Part III: Structure**  
  [Experimental validation of an aeroelasticity framework â€“ ASWING, Part III](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377725277_Experimental_validation_of_an_aeroelasticity_framework_ASWING_Part_III_Structure)

- **Part IV: Aeroelasticity**  
  [Experimental validation of an aeroelasticity framework â€“ ASWING, Part IV](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377725388_Experimental_validation_of_an_aeroelasticity_framework_ASWING_Part_IV_Aeroelasticity)

Together, these works provide a **comprehensive benchmark** of ASWING against trusted experimental and computational references, strengthening confidence in its predictive capabilities for flexible aircraft dynamics.
